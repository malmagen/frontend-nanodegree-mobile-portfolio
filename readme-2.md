-------------------------------
The main improvements that have being done, is moving out things that only need to be calculated once from the for loops. I.e. the for loop that moves the pizzas and the slider which changes the size.
Also the queryselectorAll has been changed to getElementsByClassName. The files are also minified and the pictures has been optimized using gulp.
